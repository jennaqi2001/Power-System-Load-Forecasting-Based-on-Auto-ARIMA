# Power-System-Load-Forecasting-Based-on-Auto-ARIMA
## Description
The whole project was done in 2022; it is uploaded to Github recently.
The goal of this project is to predict the power system goal based on the previous data for the next three months. The dataset, Power_Data.csv, contains time series data from 2018 to 2021.
Since the data I have is a pure time series, which means that with one variable changing through time, I will fit the ARIMA model.
## Instruction
The project is written in Jupyter Notebook. Before you start, please make sure that you have installed Jupyter Notebook on your computer.

```
pip install jupyter
```

Then, open Jupyter Notebook with:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Now you can run it block by block.
